<h1>My HOBBIES</h1>
<ol>
  <li><h2>Tweaking OS'</h2></li><br/>
  <p>I have always been curious about computers and how to optimize them. When I got my first PC<br/>
    in 2012, I felt that the operating systems were not using the hardware to its full potential.<br/>
    I tweaked my Windows 7 OS to make it faster and lighter, but I was not satisfied. I decided to<br/> 
    try different Linux distributions, which are open-source and customizable operating systems.<br/>
    However, I faced a dilemma: some Linux distros had poor user interfaces, while others were too<br/>
    demanding on the resources. I realized that I could change the appearance and functionality of<br/>
    any Linux distro by installing different software components. This inspired me to learn coding<br/>
    again and create my own operating system from scratch</p>

  <li>Windows 98</li>
